The structure of our application repository (my-application) should be organized to
promote clarity, maintainability, and testability. Here's a recommended structure,
building upon the previous examples and incorporating best practices:

my-application/
├── my_python_app/
│ ├── __init__.py
│ ├── app.py
│ ├── database.py
│ └── utils.py
├── tests/
│ ├── __init__.py
│ └── test_app.py # Updated test file
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
└── .gitignore

Explanation and Best Practices:
● Package Structure: Organize your Python code into a package
(my_python_app in this example). This helps avoid naming conflicts and
promotes better code organization.
● Modules: Separate different functionalities into modules (e.g., database.py for
database interactions, utils.py for utility functions).
● app.py (or other entry point): This file contains the main logic for your
application, including the WSGI application or other entry point.
● requirements.txt: List all your Python dependencies here. Use pip
freeze > requirements.txt to generate this file after setting up your virtual
environment.
● Dockerfile: This file defines how to build your Docker image.
● tests/: This directory contains your unit tests. Use a testing framework like
pytest or unittest. Comprehensive testing is crucial for ensuring code quality
and reliability.
● .gitignore: This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by
Git. Commonly ignored files include .pyc files, __pycache__ directories, virtual
environments (.venv), and other build artifacts.
