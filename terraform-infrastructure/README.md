The structure of our terraform-infrastructure repository will look like this:

terraform-infrastructure/
├── main.tf # Main T erraform configuration
├── variables.tf # Variable definitions
├── outputs.tf # Output definitions
├── modules/ # Reusable modules
│ └── datadog-agent/
│ ├── main.tf
│ ├── variables.tf
│ └── install_agent.sh
├── dev.tfvars # Variables for dev environment
├── prod.tfvars # Variables for prod environment
└── app_setup.sh # Shell script for instance setup (pulled into EC2 user data)

Key improvements:
● Environment-Specific Variables: The dev.tfvars and prod.tfvars files store
environment-specific variable values, keeping them separate from your main
Terraform code.

● Organized Structure: The repository is well-organized, with modules, scripts, and
variable files in their respective locations.

● Clear Separation of Concerns: The separation of environment configurations,
module definitions, and the main T erraform file promotes better maintainability
and reduces code duplication.

This well-structured repository promotes maintainability, reusability, and secure
management of environment-specific configurations. Remember to handle sensitive
data securely and never commit it to version control.
